# Isaac's Digital Notebook

**Name:** Isaac Stanek 
**School:** Oklahoma Wesleyan University

## Purpose
This repository is my digital notebook for tracking projects, things I have learned, and useful reference materials throughout my backend development course. It will include unit projects, my learning log, helpful resources, and a personal Git command cheat sheet.

## Backend Development Workspace Overview
This repository serves as my digital notebook for backend development. It contains project folders for each unit, a learning log, a resource library, and a Git reference cheat sheet.


## Learning Objectives
- Learn SQL and database management
- Improve Python scripting for backend development
- Understand RESTful API development
- Gain experience with Git/version control
- Practice testing and automation

## Plan for Using This Repository
I will track my projects, record my learning progress in `learning-log.md`, save useful resources in `resources.md`, and reference Git commands in `git-reference.md`. Each unit folder will hold notes and assignments.


## Notes
This repository will help me stay organized and ensure I can review past work for future projects.
